#### Machine Learning in Python
> All classifiers in machine learning - step by step
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


> ###### Feature selection methods:
>  - Filter method: use statistical tests
>    - Correleation
>    - Mutual Information
>  - Warpper method: use cross-validation
>  - Embedded method
> Filter methods use statistical methods for evaluation of a subset of features while warpper methods use cross validation.
