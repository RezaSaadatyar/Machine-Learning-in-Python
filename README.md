#### Machine Learning in Python
> All classifiers in machine learning - step by step
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


> **Dimensionality Reduction:**

> Feature selection methods:
>   - Filter method: 
>     - Correleation
>     - Mutual Information
>     - t-test
>     -  Univariate feature selestion: It works by selecting the best features based on univariate statistical tests. It can be seen as a preprocessing step to an estimator.
>   - Warpper method: use cross-validation
>     - Sequential forward selection (SFS)
>     - Sequential backward selection (SBS)
>     - Plus-L minus-R selection (LRS) 
>   - Embedded method
>   
> Filter methods use statistical methods for evaluation of a subset of features while warpper methods use cross validation.
> 
> Feature extraction:
>   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): It is a dimension-reduction tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the largest set (Maximising the variance of the whole set).
>   - Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA): Maximising the distance between groups
