**Classification**<br/>

**Binary Classification:**<br/>
It is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning. It aims to classify new observations into one of two possible outcomes, typically denoted as 0 or 1, true or false, positive or negative, and so on.

**How Binary Classification Works?**<br/>The process of binary classification involves training an algorithm on a dataset that has labeled data points with binary labels. The algorithm then learns how to associate input features with their respective binary labels. Once the algorithm is trained, it can be utilized to predict binary labels for new and unseen data points.

**Common Binary Classification Models:**<br/>
- `Logistic Regression:` This is utilized in problems involving binary classification, where the output variable has two categorical values.
- `Neural Networks:` This algorithm clusters input, recognizes patterns, and interprets sensory data. However, neural networks require significant computational resources, making it difficult to fit them when dealing with thousands of observations.
 - `Support Vector Machines: `Support vector machines are used for classification by creating a hyperplane that maximizes the distance between two classes of data points. This hyperplane, known as the decision boundary, separates the classes of data points on either side. For example, it could separate oranges from apples.
- `Random Forest:`It is a versatile form of supervised machine learning that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. It involves an ensemble of decision trees that work together to enhance accuracy and minimize the risk of overfitting.
- `Naive Bayes:` The Naive Bayes algorithm operates under the assumption that the input variables or features are independent of each other, given the class label. However, this assumption is considered "naive" as it does not account for the possibility of correlations between features in reality. The three primary variants of Naive Bayes are Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

**Evaluating a Binary Classification Model:**
- `True Negatives (TN):` The cases in which the model correctly predicted the negative class, and the actual outcome was indeed negative.
- `False Positives (FP):` The cases in which the model incorrectly predicted the positive class (Type I error), but the actual outcome was negative.
- `False Negatives (FN):` The cases in which the model incorrectly predicted the negative class (Type II error), but the actual outcome was positive.


Impact of False Negatives and False Positives:
False negatives and false positives can have
different impacts depending on the specific
problem and context of the classification model.
In a medical diagnosis scenario, a false negative
can result in a patient not receiving the necessary
treatment for a disease, leading to a worsened
health condition.
In airport security screening, a false positive
result for a potential threat can result in
unnecessary delays and inconvenience for the
passengers.
